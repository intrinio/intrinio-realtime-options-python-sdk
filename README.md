# intrinio-realtime-options-python-sdk
SDK for working with Intrinio's realtime options feed via WebSocket

[Intrinio](https://intrinio.com/) provides real-time and delayed stock option prices via a two-way WebSocket connection. To get started, [subscribe to a real-time data feed](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/options-data) and follow the instructions below.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- You need https://pypi.org/project/websocket-client/, not https://pypi.org/project/websocket/.

## Docker
Add your API key to the example_app.py file, then
```
docker compose build
docker compose run client
```

## Installation

Go to [Release](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-options-python-sdk/releases/), download the zip, extract client.py, and reference it in your project.

## Sample Project

For a sample Python application see: [intrinio-realtime-options-python-sdk](https://github.com/intrinio/intrinio-realtime-options-python-sdk/blob/main/example_app.py)

## Features

* Receive streaming, real-time option price updates:
	* every trade
	* conflated bid and ask
	* open interest, open, close, high, low
	* unusual activity(block trades, sweeps, whale trades (large), unusual sweep trades)
* Subscribe to updates from individual options contracts (or option chains)
* Subscribe to updates for the entire univers of option contracts (~1.5M option contracts)

```

## Handling Quotes

There are millions of options contracts, each with their own feed of activity.
We highly encourage you to make your onTrade, onQuote, onUnusualActivity, and onRefresh methods as short as possible and follow a queue pattern so your app can handle the large volume of activity.
Note that quotes (ask and bid updates) comprise 99% of the volume of the entire feed. Be cautious when deciding to receive quote updates.

## Providers

Currently, Intrinio offers realtime and delayed data for this SDK from the following providers:

* OPRA - [Homepage](https://www.opraplan.com/)


## Data Format

### Trade Message

```python
class Trade:
    def __init__(self, contract: str, exchange: Exchange, price: float, size: int, timestamp: float, total_volume: int, qualifiers: tuple, ask_price_at_execution: float, bid_price_at_execution: float, underlying_price_at_execution: float):
        self.contract: str = contract
        self.exchange: Exchange = exchange
        self.price: float = price
        self.size: int = size
        self.timestamp: float = timestamp
        self.total_volume: int = total_volume
        self.qualifiers: tuple = qualifiers
        self.ask_price_at_execution = ask_price_at_execution
        self.bid_price_at_execution = bid_price_at_execution
        self.underlying_price_at_execution = underlying_price_at_execution
```

* **contract** - Identifier for the options contract.  This includes the ticker symbol, put/call, expiry, and strike price.
* **exchange** - Exchange(IntEnum): the specific exchange through which the trade occurred
* **price** - the price in USD
* **size** - the size of the last trade in hundreds (each contract is for 100 shares).
* **total_volume** - The number of contracts traded so far today.
* **timestamp** - a Unix timestamp (with microsecond precision)
* **qualifiers** - a tuple containing 4 ints: each item represents one trade qualifier. see list of possible [Trade Qualifiers](#trade-qualifiers), below.

* **bid_price_at_execution** - the contract bid price in USD at the time of execution.
* **underlying_price_at_execution** - the contract's underlying security price in USD at the time of execution.

### Trade Qualifiers

The trade qualifiers field is represented by a tuple containing 4 integers. Each integer can take one of the following values:
* **`0`** - Regular transaction
* **`2`** - Cancel
* **`3`** - This is the last price and it's cancelled
* **`4`** - Late but in sequence / sold last late
* **`5`** - This was the open price and it's cancelled
* **`6`** - Late report of opening trade and is out of sequence: or set the open
* **`7`** - Cancel only trade reported
* **`8`** - Transaction was executed electronically
* **`9`** - Reopen of a previously halted contract
* **`11`** - Spread
* **`23`** - Intermarket Sweep
* **`30`** - Extended hours
* **`33`** - Crossed trade including Request For Cross RFC

* **`107, 23`** - Single leg auction ISO
* **`23, 33`** - Single leg cross ISO
* **`8, 11`** - Multi leg auto-electronic trade
* **`107, 11`** - Multi leg auction

## API Keys

You will receive your Intrinio API Key after [creating an account](https://intrinio.com/signup). You will need a subscription to a [realtime data feed](https://intrinio.com/financial-market-data/options-data) as well.

## Documentation

### Overview

The Intrinio Realtime Client will handle authorization as well as establishment and management of all necessary WebSocket connections. All you need to get started is your API key.
The first thing that you'll do is create a new `Client` object, passing in a series of callbacks. These callback methods tell the client what types of subscriptions you will be setting up.
After a `Client` object has been created, you may subscribe to receive feed updates from the server.
You may subscribe to static list of symbols (a mixed list of option contracts and/or option chains). 
Or, you may subscribe, dynamically, to option contracts, option chains, or a mixed list thereof.
It is also possible to subscribe to the entire universe of option contracts by switching the `Provider` to "OPRA_FIREHOSE" (in the config object) and calling `join_firehose`.
The volume of data provided by the `Firehose` exceeds 100Mbps and requires special authorization.
After subscribing, using your starting list of symbols, you will call the `start` method. The client will immediately attempt to authorize your API key (provided in the config object). If authoriztion is successful, the necessary connection(s) will be opened.
If you are using the non-firehose feed, you may update your subscriptions on the fly, using the `join` and `leave` methods.
The WebSocket client is designed for near-indefinite operation. It will automatically reconnect if a connection drops/fails and when then servers turn on every morning.
If you wish to perform a graceful shutdown of the application, please call the `stop` method.
Realtime vs delayed is automatically handled by your account authorization, but if you have realtime and wish to force delayed, you may do so via the configuration setting.

### Methods

`client : Client = Client(config : Config, on_trade : Callable[[Trade], None], on_quote : Callable[[Quote], None] = None, on_refresh : Callable[[Refresh], None] = None, on_unusual_activity : Callable[[UnusualActivity],None] = None)` - Creates an Intrinio Real-Time client.
* **Parameter** `config`: The configuration to be used by the client.
* **Parameter** `on_trade`: The Callable accepting trades. If no `on_trade` callback is provided, you will not receive trade updates from the server.
* **Parameter** `on_quote`: The Callable accepting quotes. If no `on_quote` callback is provided, you will not receive quote (ask, bid) updates from the server.
* **Parameter** `on_refresh`: The Callable accepting refresh messages. If no `on_refresh` callback is provided, you will not receive open interest, high, low, open, or close data from the server. Note: open interest data is only updated at the beginning of every trading day. If this callback is provided you will recieve an update immediately, as well as every 15 minutes (approx).
* **Parameter** `on_unusual_activity`: The Callable accepting unusual activity events. If no `on_unusual_activity` callback is provided, you will not receive unusual activity updates from the server.

---------

`client.start()` - Starts the Intrinio Realtime WebSocket Client.
	This method will immediately attempt to authorize the API key (provided in config).
	After successful authorization, all of the data processing threads will be started, and the websocket connections will be opened.
	If a subscription has already been created with one of the `join` methods, data will begin to flow.

---------

`client.join()` - Joins channel(s) configured in config.json.
`client.join(*channels)` - Joins the provided channel or channels. E.g. "AAPL", "GOOG__210917C01040000"
`client.join_firehose()` - Joins the firehose channel. This requires special account permissions.

---------

`client.leave()` - Leaves all joined channels/subscriptions, including firehose.
`client.leave(*channels)` - Leaves the specified channel or channels. E.g. "AAPL" or "GOOG__210917C01040000"
`client.leave_firehose()` Leaves the firehose channel 

---------
`client.stop();` - Stops the Intrinio Realtime WebSocket Client. This method will leave all joined channels, stop all threads, and gracefully close the websocket connection(s).
